Do you ever wanted to have some kind of device that control your favourite applications but you don't have enough money to buy it, or what you find is specific to an application(or a set of application)?

Well, with Controlizer Deck you can use a DIY input device and control everything you need, mapping controls with an useful easy-to-use Desktop app.

**NOTE: THE CURRENT IMPLEMENTATION IS MADE AND TESTED ONLY ON WINDOWS 10, SOME FEATURES ARE ONLY AVAILABLE FOR IT.** if you want that everything is compatible with a non-windows OS (aka macOS e Linux) open an issue.

### Testing
Do you want to test this project? Great!
Let's begin by defining what you need:
- an Arduino board and some electronic components (like buttons, potentiometers, wires...if you want to recycle my sketches use the components listed in the sketch's readme file).
- a pc (oh, really?)

You need Node.JS installed in order to execute the frontend and .NET Core 3.1 to execute the backend (if you have Visual Studio 2019 there aren't any issues).
