Have you ever wanted some kind of device that control your favourite applications but you don't have enough money to buy it, or what you find is specific to an application(or a set of application)?

Well, with Controlizer Deck you can use a DIY input device to control everything you need, mapping controls with an useful easy-to-use Desktop app.

**NOTE: Currently, this project is tested only on Windows 10.**
In the near future I'm planning to test on macOS.

### Testing
Do you want to test this project? Great!
Let's begin by defining what you need:
- an Arduino board and some electronic components (like buttons, potentiometers, wires...if you want to recycle my sketches use the components listed in the sketch's readme file).
- a pc (oh, really?)

You need Node.JS installed in order to execute the frontend and .NET 5 to execute the backend.
